The Google Homepage Mini Project

This is a project from the Odin project for the HTML/CSS section.

The project is to recreate the Google homepage. It aims for you to use developer tools to identify how the page is put together and then to utilise the skills already learnt to create the page.

Some of the skills that are utilised for the project are: 
To locate background color on a page, Move div on a page, make a form,
attach CSS styles to HTML, use classes and IDs, center elements and place a div at the bottom of a page.
